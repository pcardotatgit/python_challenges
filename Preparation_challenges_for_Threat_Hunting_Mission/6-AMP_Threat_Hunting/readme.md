# Challenge

We assume that you have an AMP account.   Connect to it and Activate Your Demo Data.

And then Create a client API

This challenge is an AMP Threat Hunting challenge.

Here is an observable : **01468b1d3e089985a4ed255b6594d24863cfd94a647329c631e4f4e52759f8a9** 

Question 1 : How many Endpoints are infected in your organization by this observable ?

Question 2 : What are the infected Endpoints hostnames ?

## TODO 

Write a python script which gives you the answer what ever the AMP observable is.

The solution Folder contains an example of solution.   But you have to troubleshoot the script

Go to : 

https://api-docs.amp.cisco.com/

And figure out what is the AMP API URL endpoint which can help you to get the answer.
