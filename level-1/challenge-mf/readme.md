# Paris Temperature Challenge

Here is an API that gives you back information about the Temperature trend in Paris

[Meteo in Paris](https://www.prevision-meteo.ch/services/json/lat=46.259lng=5.235)

Your challenge is to write an python script that prints out :

- Current date
- Current hour in your region
- Temperature in Paris

Have a look to the solution. This one doesn't work,  you have to troubleshoot it.
